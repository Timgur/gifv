gifv
====
A web component for gif video with fallback to original gif. Inspired by Imgur's gifv and developed in order to push boundaries and learn more about custom elements.

<h2>Example</h2>
  Add the gifv.js to the html document and add the below element to the body of the html file.
  
    <gif-v src="http://i.imgur.com/w79nkJ8.gif" />

<h2>Optional Attributes</h2>
  <strong>noloop</strong>: Will stop gif from looping and will append a replay button to bottom left of image.
